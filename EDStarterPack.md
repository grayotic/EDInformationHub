Welcome to Elite Dangerous new Commanders

So, you’ve either just bought or are considering buying Elite Dangerous. If you are on the fence about buying it, you should try the game’s [demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/xaduha/Combat-Demo-Downloader/BinaryWrapper_0.3/BinaryWrapper/CombatDemoDownloader.zip). 

When you first start out in Elite Dangerous, it’s all about learning your bindings, finding out what is going to blow you up (which will happen a lot), and learning how to traverse the galaxy. Basic data or cargo delivery missions can net you some easy starting credits. Your goal should either be to upgrade to a combat craft or a trading craft. If you have Horizons, don’t be afraid to jump into a multi-crew session to not only learn the ropes of combat, but to also earn some easy starting credits, risk free. 

Also,  the combat training is a challenge even for experienced pilots.  Don't get hung up on being able to complete it, just jump into the game.

A path for new players who want to jump straight into money making, instead of taking their time, is to save up for a [Hauler](https://eddp.co/u/thRN5KGf) by doing some [bounty hunting](https://youtu.be/gf_7bwlIytA) in a [Resource Extraction Site](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/132183-Simple-Guide-to-RES-Resource-Extraction-Site-Bounty-Hunting) within a good [system](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/126763-A-list-of-systems-with-convenient-RES-locations) for it. Then, start doing [road to riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6hhcpq/road_to_riches_web_app/) using this [app](http://edtools.ddns.net/expl.php). Upgrade to a [Diamondback Explorer](https://eddp.co/u/st21rNNE) after a short run of it, then save up for a Python. I also suggest unlocking [Felicity Farseer](https://inara.cz/galaxy-engineer/1/), one of the game’s engineers, to get yourself longer jump distances and other cool upgrades. Note that The Engineers requires Horizons.

Some basic tips:

1. Bind a key to "set forward thrusters to 75%." When in supercruise, hit this button and it will take you all the way into your destination and wont overshoot. If you want to get there faster, press this key when your time remaining to reach your destination is at 7s, when going full throttle. On consoles,  I suggest binding it to LB+RB on Xbox or L1+R1 on PS4.

2. If you are struggling when using keyboard/mouse, try taking the roll axis off the mouse and put it on keys A & D, respectively, and replace it with yaw axis. This is easier for some people. 

3. If you are travelling more than a few jumps, buy a fuel scoop.

4. Never fly without rebuy (insurance money to replace your ship if it gets destroyed).

5. Switch your bind for target next subsystem to target previous subsystem.  It'll cycle to the power plant faster. 

6. Set a binding for "target next system in route", so that if you have a route plotted and target anything else, you can quickly target the next system to jump to in your route again.  I suggest B+clicking LS on Xbox or O+clicking LS on PS4.

7. There are a number of unbound gamepad inputs for consoles that are good for binding chaff,  heatsinks,  and SCBs to that prevent the need to use them in fire groups. On Xbox they are B+LB, B+RB, and B+LB+RB. On PS4 they are O+L1, O+R1, and O+L1+R1. Note that these aren't the only ones if you get creative with clicking multiple buttons. 

8. When flying in supercruise and the HUD says "Slow Down", it's not telling you to slow yourself down,  but rather,  it's telling you that a gravity well is slowing YOU down.
