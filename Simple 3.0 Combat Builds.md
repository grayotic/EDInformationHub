# Simple PvP combat builds for 3.0

This document will provide ED Shipyard links to simple & effective combat builds for the most commonly-used PvP ships in Elite – the Alliance Chieftain, Federal Assault Ship, Fer-de-Lance, Imperial Clipper, and Vulture – as well as a brief overview of the builds.

The builds presented here are meant to provide new PvPers (or PvPers new to one of the ships mentioned) with an effective starting point with both a high skill ceiling as well as a relatively low skill floor – that is to say they will be neither skill-limited in terms of development nor will the builds be too difficult for a new PvPer to use.

Experienced PvPers will recognize that countless variations are possible, dependent on personal preference, personal skill levels, and situational conditions. The builds in this document are strong “cookie-cutter” builds, with some simple variations listed; more complicated builds/theorycrafting will come down to personal knowledge & experience.

At the end of the document are general “rules” for engineering. These are not hard & fast; there is no requirement to strictly adhere to them, but are simply best-practice guidelines for those who don’t want to get caught up in the minutiae of engineering theory.

More up-front shield strength than the meta-lance at the cost of lowered regen; more overall shield strength than the big prismatic version at the cost of being more negatively-affected if feedbacked.

Build identical to big prismo, except

This is a Vulture stretched to its functional limits. Credit to CMDR spuddymarvel.

 

N.B.: this requires you to shut off your cargo hatch and have your FSD and FSD interdictor shut down when hardpoints are deployed (put them on priority 5, be sure to check your cargo hatch if you die).

#### Engineering guidelines

##### Core internals

Armor:

\- Reactive Surface Composites is generally chosen. This allows you to balance your resists when paired with a thermal-resistant HRP as your smallest HRP. RSC armor only requires you balance one type of damage (thermal), as compared to two (kinetic + explosive) on milgrade or mirrored armor.

Plants:

\- Biweave builds generally want armored plants.

\- Overcharged plants are best with lowest possible grade that provides enough power without using the Monstered experiemtnal. e.g. an OC3 thermal spread plant provides more power and less heat than an OC2 monstered plant.

\- 6B plants (for more integrity) are worth it only in niche situations.

Distro:

\- Charge-enhanced is always the go-to mod.

- Superconduits is generally better than cluster capacitors. Cluster caps can be useful in high-alpha, super high-distro draw builds – these are very niche.

Thrusters:

- Always dirty drives. Even if you’re planning a silent running build.

\- Generally, drag drives are for normal thrusters; drive distributors are for enhanced-performance thrusters.

FSDs:

\- For combat builds, full size or 2D FSDs can both be appropriate. Full size FSDs can be vanilla, increased range, or shielded. 2D FSDs can be vanilla or shielded. Full size FSDs are useful since 3.0 C&P often means you can’t restock/repair in the system you may be in.

- Mass manager is usually better than deep charge for size size 5+ FSDs in terms of single-hop max range. However, even on size 4 & smaller FSDs, mass manager generally provides more total jump range than deep charge for a given fuel tank size.

Sensors:

\- Lightweight is risky on biweave builds since it lowers sensor integrity, which is fairly low to start with. No sensors = you’re out of the fight. On pure shield tanks, lightweight can usually be safely maxed out.

\- Long range sensors (any grade) are a viable alternative, as are vanilla sensors.

\- D-rated sensors are chosen for speed gains & weight/power savings.

##### Utilities

\- Chaff & heat sinks should be modded for ammo capacity.

\- If you need point-defense, it should be reinforced.

\- Resist boosters experimentals are somewhat lacking. Flow control reduces power with no downsides. The resist experimentals generally won’t help much, though they can sometimes be marginally useful. Supercaps can also be used on resist boosters and can sometimes provide more effective hp. Play around on EDShipyard to find out or ask in GCI for help.

\- For Prismatic FDLs, a 3HD + 1TR booster setup give you a bit more absolute (raw) protection at the cost of a bit less kinetic protection compared to a 2HD + 1TR + 1RA booster setup.

##### Optional internals

- Prismatics should generally be reinforced + hi-cap.

- Biweaves should generally be thermal resistant.

- Lo-draw shields can often get your shields back quicker than fast charge. The latter’s higher distro draw means your regen may be limited by your SYS cap running dry. Lo-draw also allows you to be more aggressive, especially when shields are down, since you don’t need to devote as much pip-time to your SYS cap.

- Recycling cells provide marginally more shield restoration on shield cell banks at essentially no cost. Boss cells are never worth it in PvP as they provide approximately the same shield restoration increase as recycling cells, but leave you vulnerable to feedback for longer.

- HRPs should usually be heavy duty + deep plating. If running reactive armor, the smallest HRP should be thermal resistant. The secondary on this last HRP does not generally make a significant difference, but deep plating is a safe default choice if none of your other resists are severely lacking – and if they are, HRP resist experimentals won’t help much anyway.

- MRPs can’t be modded. A 4D2D setup (or 4D3D or similar) is a safe choice. A single 5D MRP can be used to gain more hull at the cost of some module protection.

\- MRP protection stacks multiplicatively. Two MRPs provides 84% protection to internal modules; one MRP provides 60%; more than two is generally not worth it.

- FSD interdictors don’t need to be modded. They can be run A-rated or D-rated. If modding, A-rated + expanded capture arc is a good combination.

\- FSDs interdictors in the build above are only modded to G3 since that’s the highest grade attainable with the engineers most people have unlocked (i.e. highest grade outside of Col. Bris Dekker).
